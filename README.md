# 🚗 Fuel Efficiency Prediction with Python 🧠📈

![Fuel Efficiency Prediction](https://github.com/zxurie/Fuel-Efficiency-Prediction--Python/releases/tag/v2.0)

Welcome to the "Fuel-Efficiency-Prediction--Python" repository! This project is a great way to get hands-on experience with regression techniques by predicting fuel efficiency using the Auto MPG dataset. Through this project, you will build a Neural Network with RMSprop, MSE loss, data normalization, and early stopping to prevent overfitting. The key aspects of this project are to normalize the data, use MAE/MSE for evaluation, and optimize the model to achieve accurate predictions.

## 📜 About the Project
The main goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to predict the fuel efficiency of vehicles based on various features present in the Auto MPG dataset. By leveraging deep learning with a Neural Network approach, we aim to create a model that can accurately predict fuel efficiency, which is crucial in today's world of increasing emphasis on sustainability and environmental conservation.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with the project, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Additionally, familiarize yourself with concepts such as regression, neural networks, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. This project provides a great opportunity to apply these concepts in a practical setting.

## 🔧 Installation
To install the necessary libraries and dependencies for this project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r https://github.com/zxurie/Fuel-Efficiency-Prediction--Python/releases/tag/v2.0
```

## 💻 Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the main Python script to train the Neural Network model on the Auto MPG dataset.
4. Evaluate the model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters, adjusting the architecture, or experimenting with different loss functions.
